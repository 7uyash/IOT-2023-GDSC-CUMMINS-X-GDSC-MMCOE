Problem Statement - Create a simulated weather-based control system, expected to run on platforms like Gazebo, MATLAB, or CoppeliaSim, where environmental conditions trigger automated actions, helping to mimic real-world scenarios for testing and research.

Description - Develop a simulated weather-based control system intended for deployment on platforms such as Gazebo, MATLAB, or CoppeliaSim. The system should be designed to respond to changing environmental conditions and trigger automated actions, thereby facilitating the emulation of real-world scenarios for testing and research purposes. It should involve the integration of weather data, sensors, actuators, and control algorithms to create a dynamic simulation environment where the response of various systems or devices to weather fluctuations can be studied comprehensively.
