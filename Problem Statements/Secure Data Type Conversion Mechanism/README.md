Problem Statement - Develop a mechanism in TCP/IP programming that safely handles the conversion of different data types without causing security vulnerabilities or errors, ensuring smooth communication between devices.

Description - Devise a mechanism within TCP/IP programming that can adeptly manage the conversion of various data types without introducing security vulnerabilities or operational errors, thereby guaranteeing seamless communication between interconnected devices. This mechanism needs to account for the heterogeneity of data types that devices might exchange during communication and ensure that such conversions are performed safely, adhering to robust data validation and sanitization practices.
